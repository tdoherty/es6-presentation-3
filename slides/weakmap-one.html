<ul style="list-style: none">
    <li class="fragment">Simple key-value map where the key is a weakly-held object</li>
    <!--<li class="fragment">A WeakMap holds only a weak reference to a key, which means the reference inside of the WeakMap doesn’t prevent garbage collection of that object<br><br></li>-->
