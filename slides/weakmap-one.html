<h2>WeakMap</h2>

<ul style="list-style: none">
    <li class="fragment">An unordered list of key-value pairs where the key must be a non-null object and the value can be of any type<br><br></li>
    <li class="fragment">A WeakMap holds only a weak reference to a key, which means the reference inside of the WeakMap doesnâ€™t prevent garbage collection of that object<br><br></li>
    <li class="fragment">Primary use case is mapping values to objects that might disappear later, such as DOM elements</li>
</ul>
